When a response is submitted to a Request Form a notification is sent to members of a teams channel. 
The notification tells users that a new response has been submitted and a task has been added to their planner, containing the response ID and other details.
This also contains an email action which will send an email to the person who fills in the form. 
The first condition tells the members of a teams channel if a file has been uploaded or not.

There are a few pitfalls on Microsofts behalf which have made this flow slightly innefficient, on my form users are able to upload a file.
In an ideal world I would have another arm which attaches the upload straight to the task but this is not possible.
    Please find the solution on my profile under Attachment Processing :)
